# Dart Programming and OOP Concepts
Dart is a versatile programming language developed by Google, designed for building fast and scalable applications, especially for web and mobile development. 
It is widely used in the Flutter framework to create beautiful, natively compiled apps for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Dart supports object-oriented programming (OOP) 
principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making it easier to structure code efficiently. It features classes and interfaces to create modular, reusable code, 
and its support for mixins and abstract classes allows for advanced code functionality. Dart's emphasis on OOP concepts helps developers write clean, organized, and maintainable code.
